*Automation Controller fixes:*

* Node alias is now saved when job template is changed in the workflow
* Improved error messages in the API `job_explanation` field for
specific error scenarios, (e.g., runner worker process is killed), or
certain failure scenarios (e.g., shutdown)
* Fixed the Task Manager to fully account for the job's control process
capacity for jobs running in container groups
* Fixed a few bugs that caused delays in task processing by adding the
following file-based settings:::
  ** `JOB_WAITING_GRACE_PERIOD` increases the threshold for marking jobs
  stuck in the "waiting" status as failed
  ** `CLUSTER_NODE_MISSED_HEARTBEAT_TOLERANCE` to allow the heartbeat to
  be more tolerant to clock skew and other problems
  ** `K8S_POD_REAPER_GRACE_PERIOD` to allow more time before pod cleanup
  executes its last attempt to delete pods used by jobs
  ** `TASK_MANAGER_TIMEOUT` to allow more time in the unlikely event
  that the Task Manager fails to finish normally
* Jobs no longer fail for nested submodules in an SCM (git) project and
the `.git` folder will be omitted
* Added more logs to help debug database connectivity problems and
cluster resource limits
* Removed the `current_user` cookie which was not used by the UI
* Updated controller to send FQCN data for tasks to analytics
* Fixed the metrics endpoint (`/api/v2/metrics`) to no longer produce
erroneous `500` errors
* Added `remove_superuser` and `remove_system_auditors` to the SAML user
attribute map
* Added the ability to allow multiple values in the
`SOCIAL_AUTH_SAML_USER_FLAGS_BY_ATTR.is_*_[value|role]` settings
* Unwanted Galaxy credentials are no longer added to the Organization
while logging in through SAML
* awx-cli now allows for multiple `--extra_vars` parameters
* Receptor no longer fails in FIPS mode
* If an OCP node's record is deleted (either by the `awx-manage` command
or by the heartbeat task), it will re-register itself
* Upgrading and changing `node_type` from `execution` to `control` or
`hybrid` no longer causes cleanup errors
